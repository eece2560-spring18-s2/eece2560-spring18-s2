## Overview
This course covers the design and implementation of algorithms to solve engineering problems using a high-level programming language. Reviews elementary data structures, such as arrays, stacks, queues, and lists, and introduces more advanced structures, such as trees and graphs and the use of recursion. Covers both the algorithms to manipulate these data structures as well as their use in problem solving. Introduces algorithm complexity analysis and its application to developing efficient algorithms. Emphasizes the importance of software engineering principles.

## Prerequisites

This course requires either EECE2510 or CS1500. A solid C++ programming skill is required. Students should be very comfortable with writing loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and classes.

## Communication

This course uses Piazza as the communication platform. You can put any type of questions and information to Piazza. Private messages are strongly discouraged.

When you ask questions about coding, make sure you follow the [Question Guidelines of StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). Your questions should be general and able to help others that may have the same questions. Also, you have to state what you have tried to solve your question and why it does not work. Questions like "why my code does not work" will generally not be answered by the instructor.

Collaborations between students are encouraged. Although there will be no extra credit for helping others, you will find teaching and trtoring are very rewarding. If you have general questions such as "why my code does not work", you can still post them on Piazza and I am expecting it can be solved by your peer students.

## Assignments

Assignments are given in a mini-project format. There will generally be a mini-project each week. All the mini-projects should be completed individually. All the assignment will allow 2 weeks to solve. So you should plan your time wisely. No extension will be granted throughout the semester.

All the assignments are distributed and collected via Github classroom. Therefore, students are required to learn how to use Git by themselves. When an assignment is anounced, you will receive a link to accept the assignment. You can follow the link and the instructions to create a repo for your assignment. Your last commit before the deadline will be considered as your final submission.

All the assignments code need to be able to compile and run on a Linux machine. For each assignment, a auto-checking program is provided and when you push to Github, the system will check if you have solved all the coding problems. For any coding problem, if it cannot compile, no more than 20% of the score will be given, and if it cannot pass the auto checking system, no more than 50% of the score will be given. Also, consistent indentation is a very basic professionalism of a programmer. In our assignment, we roughly follow the Google coding guideline. Therefore, please make sure you are familiar with the [Google C++ coding styles](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). If your submitted code is terriblly indented, 50% of your score will be deducted. So, after submission, please make sure your code looks well-aligned on Github.
