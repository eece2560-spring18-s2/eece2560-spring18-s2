# Final Project

## Description

Final course projects count as 20% of your final grade, with an optional
additional 10% extra credit for those projects with novel features, or
outstanding presentations. You can work on your final course project
individually or in groups of no more than three students.

Please use the link posted to Piazza to accept for the final project and push
all the mertials to the created git repo. The deadline for the final project
will be at 11:59pm EST, Dec 8th 2017. No submissions will be accepted after the
given deadline. Submissions by email will not be accepted either.

## Submission

Your project submission consists of three parts:

1. A porject report `readme.md`, written in markdown format and should be
   directly viewable on Github. The whole report should be no more than 2000
   words.

1. Push all your C, C++, or Simulink files to the Github repo. Any C or C++ code
   should be accompanied by a Makefile, and should compile with no errors on the
   ZedBoard or a CoE machine. Any submitted Simulink file should run a
   simulation and be synthesized on the ZedBoard without errors. Also make sure
   to give an instruction in your `readme.md` file about how to compile and run
   your project. 

1. A link to a YouTube Video with a demo of your project, with a **maximum
   duration of 2 minutes**. Add this link to the end of your `readme.md` file.
   If you work in a team, make sure that all members get equal opportunities to
   participate in the presentation.

## Report

Your project report should have the following sections:

1. Project title
1. Project description

    List here all deatures of your project, and give some technical details
    about their implementation. Also, give instructions on how to repeat your
    experiments.

1. Relevance

    Cite here what parts of the course material you are exercising for the
    design of the project. Explain what additional concepts this project helped
    you to learn.

1. Roles

    If you work in a group, describe here how each member contributed to the
    development of the project.

1. YouTube link

    Add here a clickable link to a public YouTube video.

## Project topics

Just in order to give you an idea of the complexity expected from your final
project, here are some examples of project topics chosen by other students in
the past:

* Write a calculator on the ZedBoard, using switches as inputs, and LEDs as
  outputs.

* Program the robotic arm with more complex and human-like movements. For
  example, have it move an object, shake hands, high five, draw on a board with
  a marker, etc.

* Synchronize movements in the Wiimote with movements in the robotic arm. Think
  of a situation where the robot is located in an inaccessible environment for a
  human, such as a vacuum room, or a very low-temperature space, where you would
  want a robot to mimic the movements of your own body.

* Control hardware devices on the ZedBoard using the keyboard. For example, use
  keys to move the robot in different directions, or write a program that
  interprets commands, such as “dance”, “lay down”, or “grab an object”.

* Write a simple computer game that involves interaction with hardware devices
  and the ZedBaord.

These are just some examples, and you are encouraged to come up with your own project ideas.

Use the first week for brainstorming, and share your project proposal with
me by November 3rd, either after class or on Slack. I will help you assess
the feasibility and complexity of the project and refine your idea.
